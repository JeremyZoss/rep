Abstract
========

This REP discusses the capability to develop joint-space trajectories for robotic arms for which a pre-existing cartesian path is defined. The cartesian path may be fully defined (6 DOF) or under-defined (< 6 DOF).

Definitions
=========

The following definitions are used throughout:
 * joint, axis - A single controllable item.  Typically revolute(rotational) or linear motion.
 * joint trajectory - A set of joint points, where each joint point fully defines the position of the robot.

Motivation
==========

Motion planners in ROS are primarily focused on joint-space planners that get the robot from state A to state B. The planners may create smooth, collision-free paths that may also hold a constraint along that path (e.g. holding a cup upright). Many processes that industrial robots are employed for have a pre-determined cartesian path. This path typically has a defined position for each point. The path may require exact position and orientation, loose position and/or orientation, or even undefined orientation (all or part).


Requirements
=========

The planner shall meet the following requirements:
 * 
 


Interface

Todo's
=========
The following items still need to be addressed:
